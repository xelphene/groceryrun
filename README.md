# About

GroceryRun is a simple grocery list for Android (my first Android app).  It
can maintain an inventory and set specific orders for inventory check and
shopping lists with drag and drop.

# Features

* Items can be kept in an inventory list to check on in the future and add quickly or simply stored as one-off items

* "Quick add" will autocomplete based on inventory items

* Set list orders with drag & drop

* Different ordering of items for inventory check versus shopping

* Import from text files (with SAF support)

* Data stored in local sqlite database
